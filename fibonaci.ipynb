    "In contrast to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which establishes a connection and ensures that the other end receives any packets sent, UDP does not guarantee any delivery of packets. It doesn't require any acknowledgement that the data has been received.\n",

    "\n",
    "TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and it requires handshaking to set up end-to-end communications. Once a connection is set up, data can be sent bidirectionally over the connection. TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of packets in the same order they were sent. It does this through a method called \"positive acknowledgement with re-transmission\", where the receiving end communicates back to the sender that it has received the data. If the sender does not get a correct response, it will resend the packets to ensure the recipient receives them. Packets are also checked for errors. TCP is used where reliability is more important than speed, such as web servers, email, file transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple messages are sent as packets in chunks using UDP. Delivery and order of packets are not guaranteed in UDP which makes it faster. UDP is used where speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary. For example, UDP is frequently used for live broadcasts and online games.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in terms of raw speed, UDP is faster than TCP. But remember, the speed at which a packet travels is just one part of performance. Depending on the use case, the reliability that TCP offers can be more beneficial than the speed increase UDP might provide."
